  <h2>A little bit about me:</h2>
  <p data-start="0" data-end="350"><img src="images/camping.jpg" width="150px" style="float:left; margin-right:15px; border-radius: 10px; border: 5px solid #fff; transform: rotate(-5deg);" alt="Camping"/>I am a passionate and dedicated educator who blends creativity, technology, and real-world experience to prepare students for rewarding careers in design and web development. With more than twenty-five years of professional practice in both graphic and web design, I bring deep industry knowledge into every lesson. I draw from years of client work, branding projects, and web development to show students exactly how the skills they learn in class translate into professional opportunities. My goal is to bridge the gap between education and industry, ensuring that students see the immediate and long-term value of what they create.</p>

Students move beyond theory by creating logos, websites, and complete branding packages for real-world clients, gaining practical understanding of deadlines, revisions, and professional standards. Through these projects, students build strong, competency-based portfolios that can be evaluated for college credit, giving them a head start in higher education and the job market. They leave my classroom with marketable skills and the confidence to step directly into creative careers or continue their education with a competitive edge.</p>

I encourage teamwork, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving, helping students grow not only as designers and developers but as adaptable, thoughtful individuals ready to contribute to their communities and workplaces. By guiding them to take ownership of their work and to learn from constructive feedback, I help them develop resilience and the ability to thrive in fast-changing industries. Through this balance of technical mastery and personal growth, I strive to inspire lifelong learning and creativity in every student I teach.</p>
