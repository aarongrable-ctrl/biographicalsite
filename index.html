  <p>My name is Aaron Grable and I am a graphic design and web design teacher at El Camino High School.  I like anything having to do with nature because I grew up in Oregon but now call Fallbrook my home.  I was in the Navy and I now have two old English sheepdogs named Henry and Murphy.</p>
    <p>I’m Aaron Grable, a CTE graphic design and web design teacher at El Camino High School in Oceanside, CA. I help North County San Diego students build college- and career-ready portfolios through project-based learning, real-world client work, and industry tools like Adobe Creative Cloud, HTML/CSS, and WordPress. My classes articulate with MiraCosta College for potential credit, and I prioritize inclusive, accessible instruction and community partnerships so every student can publish professional work they’re proud to share.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3>Favorite Things</h3>
  <p>I really enjoy being outdoors, being active with my family and eating good food. I think if I were to be able to combine all of those, it would be paradise. </p>
